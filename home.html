        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>By encouraging state-by-state legislative action and <strong>increasing access to orthotic and prosthetic care for active lifestyles</strong>, So Kids Can Move aims to continue to challenge healthcare injustice with a policy solution founded on dignity and justice. 
            28x28 is our ultimate objective. 
            To pass this legislation in 28 states before the 2028 Paralympics in Los Angeles, igniting a movement for change across the country and offering the chance for pursuing federal, nationwide reform.

        <h2>WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhS9jfCLLxU" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Alex was living an active lifestyle, like swimming, biking, running, and hiking before he had stage II bone cancer on his knee when he was 15 years old.
            Alex got amputated to stop the spreading of cancer. With this video, he wants to shine a light to the cost of assistive technology that people with disabilities have to face.
